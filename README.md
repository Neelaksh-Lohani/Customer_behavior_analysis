# Customer_behavior_analysis
This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior to uncover actionable business insights using data analytics techniques. The primary objective is to understand customer demographics, buying patterns, product preferences, and subscription influence in order to support strategic, data-driven business decisions.
The analysis is conducted on a dataset containing approximately 3,900 purchase transactions collected across multiple product categories and geographical locations. The dataset includes customer demographic attributes, transaction details, review ratings, discount usage, product categories, and subscription status. The project follows a structured data analytics pipeline involving data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, database integration, and business intelligence analysis.

Python was used extensively for data cleaning and transformation. Missing values in review ratings were handled using median imputation grouped by product category to maintain statistical reliability. Column names were standardized for consistency, and new analytical features such as customer age group segmentation and purchase frequency indicators were engineered to enhance behavioral analysis. The cleaned dataset was then integrated into a PostgreSQL database to perform advanced SQL queries and derive business insights.

The project identifies key revenue drivers and highlights customer segments contributing significantly to overall sales performance. Analysis revealed that loyal and repeat customers account for a major portion of revenue, demonstrating strong customer retention patterns. The study also examined discount usage behavior and identified several products with high discount dependency, providing insights into pricing optimization and promotional strategy effectiveness. Additionally, subscription analysis revealed untapped potential in converting repeat customers into long-term subscribers, presenting opportunities for improving customer engagement and retention.

This project demonstrates practical application of Python, SQL, and data analytics techniques to solve real-world business problems. It provides valuable insights that can help organizations optimize marketing campaigns, enhance customer segmentation strategies, improve product positioning, and maximize profitability.
